 <item name="messaging_systemMessage_1_body"><![CDATA[Hello Space Pilot,<br />
<br />We would like to introduce our latest update to DarkOrbit - the messaging system! The old, internal clan messaging system has been revamped completely, and the new system contains brand new functions.<br />
<br />
New additions:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Messages can now be sent quickly and easily to several players</li>
<li>Overview is clearly arranged and more compact.</li>
<li>E-Mails are saved for two weeks. At which time the system automatically delets them. If you wish to keep certain e-mails, you may save them a note.</li>
<li>Easy access to your friend list and send messages conveniently (Initially, friends can only be entered via their profile page).</li>
<li>The handy note system allows you to save up to ten messages or to save created notes permanently. Premium players may save up to 50 notes.</li>
<li>The blacklist allows you to block messages from unwelcome players.</li>
</ul>
<br />Please be advised that messages containing pornographic, racist or promotional contents will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be dealt with in accordance to our Terms and Conditions.<br /><br />
Should you have any additional questions or require additional information, please read our the FAQs in the forum.<br />
<br />Please enjoy the new messaging system.
